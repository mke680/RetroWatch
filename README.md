# RetroWatch

Retro Clock Face for the FitBit Ionic. Inspired by vintage Casio Digital Watches.

Features:
- 7 Segment Display https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-lcd-clock
- Digital Clock, Digital Date and Day Display. Supports 24H and 12H. No support for American Date. *Always dd-MM ddd*
- Heart Rate Graph Supports 60 - 140 BPM
- Steps (supports yards and meters) *Easiest to achieve a rough 5 digit count per day, if you do more than 99,999 steps... sit down*
- Active Time per day 

WIP:
- Compass Feature *No Magnetometer. Uses point to point GPS coordinates to work out general bearings* (WIP)
  - Works Intermittently on watch. Possibly something to do with how often the GPS actually refreshes.
